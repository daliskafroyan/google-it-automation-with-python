# Perfect Tenses and Modals
## WEEK 1 - Present Perfect Tense
* * *
### **Present Perfect Statements**
The present perfect is used to indicate a link between the present and the past. The time of the action is **before now but not specified**, and we are often more interested in the **result** than in the action itself.

### The present perfect is used to describe

When the time period referred to has not finished, We're still still specify duration of the time because actions started in the past and continuing in the present.
- They **haven't lived** here for years.
- She **has worked** in the bank for five years.
- We **have had** the same car for ten years.
- **Have you played** the piano since you were a child?
- I **have worked** hard this week.
- It **has rained** a lot this year.
- We **haven't seen** her today.

Actions repeated in an unspecified period between the past and now.
- They **have seen** that film six times
- It **has happened** several times already.
- She **has visited** them frequently.
- We **have eaten** at that restaurant many times.

Actions completed in the very recent past (+just)
- Have **you just finished** work?
- I **have just eaten**.
- We **have just seen** her.
- **Has he just left**?

When the precise time of the action is not important or not known
- Someone **has eaten** my soup!
- **Have you seen** 'Gone with the Wind'?
- **She's studied** Japanese, Russian, and English.

### **Present Perfect vs. Present Perfect Progressive**
Present Perfect Progressive used to emphasize
the **action** of the sentence (as opposed to the result).
- I **have been writing** many letters


<br/>

### **Present perfect vs. Past Simple**
The present perfect tells us about something that occurred at some indefinite period in the past. However, if something happened at a specific point in time in the past (“last night,” “two years ago,” “yesterday,” etc.), then we must use the past simple tense.


### Present Perfect
- I **have lived** in Lyon.
- They **have eaten** Thai food.	
- **Have you seen** 'Othello'?	
- **We have been** to Ireland.

### Simple past
- I **lived** in Lyon in 1989.
- They **ate** Thai food last night.
- Where **did** you see 'Othello'?
- When **did** you go to Ireland?

another example:
- Where have all students gone?
- Why has your mother called you three times today?
- How has he passed all of the quizes?
- When has your brother visited you?
- Have you guys eaten yet?
- She has gone to buy them food.
- Have they gone to buy them food?
- “She’s been to Prague when she was a little girl.” **(incorrect)**
-  “She went to Prague when she was a little girl.” **(correct)**

### **Active and Passive Voice in Present Perfect**
The passive voice is often used in formal texts. Switching to the active voice will make your writing clearer and easier to read.
- The document **has been sent** already. -> I **have sent** the document already.
- He **has prepared** great slides for the presentation. -> Great slides **have been prepared** for the presentation.
